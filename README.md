## Installation

To install the Gemini Lite for Laravel package, use ```composer require liteopensource/gemini-lite-laravel``` or add the following line to your `composer.json`

```json
"require": {
    "liteopensource/gemini-lite-laravel": "^0.0.3"
}
```

Then run:
```composer update```

## Configuration

Publish your config file ```geminilite.php``` using:

```php artisan vendor:publish --tag="geminilite-config"```

Add your Gemini API key to your ```.env``` file:

```GEMINILITE_SECRET_API_KEY=your_api_key_here```

## GeminiService

GeminiService provides methods to interact with the Gemini AI model.

### Creating a New Chat

Example of starting a new chat session:

```php
use LiteOpenSource\GeminiLiteLaravel\Src\Facades\Gemini;

$chat = Gemini::newChat();
```

### Sending Prompts

To send a prompt to the Gemini model:

```php
$response = $chat->newPrompt("Your prompt here");
```

### Changing Model Configuration

You can modify the model configuration at runtime:

```php
$chat->setGeminiModelConfig($temperature, $topK, $topP, $maxOutputTokens, $returnMimeType);
```

## UploadFileToGeminiService

This service allows you to upload files for processing by Gemini.

### Processing Files from a Path

To process a file from a local path:

```php
use LiteOpenSource\GeminiLiteLaravel\Src\Facades\UploadFileToGemini;

$filePath = storage_path('your/file/path.file');
$fileProcessed = UploadFileToGemini::processFileFromPath($filePath);

$uri = $fileProcessed->getUri();
$mimeType = $fileProcessed->getMimeType();

```

### Processing Uploaded Files

> This is really useful when you work with Livewire and using ```use WithFileUploads;```

To process an uploaded file:

```php
use LiteOpenSource\GeminiLiteLaravel\Src\Facades\UploadFileToGemini;

$file = $request->file($yourFile);
$fileProcessed = UploadFileToGemini::processFileFromUpload($file);

$uri = $fileProcessed->getUri();
$mimeType = $fileProcessed->getMimeType();
```

## Examples

### Text-Based Chat

You can **keep chat history** easily:

```php
$gemini = Gemini::newChat();
$response = $gemini->newPrompt('How much is 1 + 1?');
$followUp = $gemini->newPrompt('Add 8 to the previous result');
```

### Image-Based Chat

You can combine image prompt and text prompt in the only one prompt

```php
$testImagePath = storage_path('app/public/test_image.jpeg');
$uploadedFile = UploadFileToGemini::processFileFromPath($testImagePath);

$gemini = Gemini::newChat();
$response = $gemini->newPrompt(
    "What do you see in this image?",
    $uploadedFile->getUri(),
    $uploadedFile->getMimeType()
);

```

### Changing Configuration at Runtime

```php
$gemini = Gemini::newChat();
$gemini->setGeminiModelConfig(1, 40, 0.95, 8192, 'text/plain');
$response = $gemini->newPrompt('Generate a creative story');
```
